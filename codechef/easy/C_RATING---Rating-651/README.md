## Problem

### Chess Ratings

Alice has recently started playing Chess. Her current rating is $X$. She noticed that when she wins a game, her rating increases by $8$ points.

Can you help Alice in finding out the  **minimum**  number of games she needs to win in order to make her rating greater than or equal to $Y$?

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain an integer $T$ — the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains two integers $X$ and $Y$, as described in the problem statement.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the  **minimum**  number of games that Alice needs to win in order to make her rating greater than or equal to $Y$.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^4$
- $1 \leq X \leq Y \leq 10^4$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
10 10
10 17
10 18
10 19

```

```
0
1
1
2
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Since Alice's current rating $X$ is already equal to her desired rating $Y$, she doesn't need to win any game.

 **Test case $2$:**  Alice's current rating is $10$. After winning $1$ game, her rating will become $10+8=18$, which is greater than her desired rating of $17$. Thus, she has to win at least $1$ game.

 **Test case $3$:**  Alice's current rating is $10$. After winning $1$ game, her rating will become $10+8=18$, which is equal to her desired rating of $18$. Thus, she has to win at least $1$ game.

 **Test case $4$:**  Alice's current rating is $10$. After winning $1$ game, her rating will become $18$, which is less than her desired rating of $19$. She will need to win one more game in order to make her rating $26$, which is greater than $19$. Thus, she has to win at least $2$ games.

            } else {
                int diff = y - x;
                int games = (diff + 7) / 8; 
                System.out.println(games);
            }
